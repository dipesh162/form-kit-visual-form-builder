# FormKit â€“ Pixel Perfect Edition
Live: https://form-kit-visual-form-builder.vercel.app/

This repo is optimized for the design exercise: **visual polish**, **smooth drag & drop**, and a **pixel-perfect overlay** to match your mock images precisely.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000 and click Start building
```

## Why Tailwind v3 here?
Tailwind v4 requires a different PostCSS plugin (`@tailwindcss/postcss`). To avoid environment mismatch, this project uses **Tailwind v3**, which is stable and compiles out of the box with Next 15.

## Pixel-perfect overlay
On `/builder`, use the floating **Pixel-perfect overlay**:
- Upload your mock PNG/JPG
- Toggle Enable
- Adjust **opacity slider** to align layout/typography/spacings
